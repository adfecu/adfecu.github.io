    <p id="why">
        <strong>Why make this?</strong> <a href="https://dominicantoday.com/dr/world/2025/06/09/abinader-calls-for-urgent-global-action-on-sargassum-crisis/">Sargassum seaweed has caused a climate emergency in the Dominican Republic</a>. 
    </p>
    <p id="how">
        <strong>How does it work?</strong> We monitor social media posts and news articles to track seaweed levels at popular hotels in Punta Cana. The data is updated regularly based on the latest reports from visitors and local sources. The seaweed levels are categorized as None, Low, or High based on the latest beach pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Limitations?</strong> Hotels don't publish live seaweed data (probably for a reason). Using social media as a data source has limitations but seems to be a good indicator.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why does sargassum appear in the DR?</strong> Sargassum seaweed blooms are caused by a combination of factors, including nutrient-rich waters, rising ocean temperatures, and changing currents. These conditions create the perfect environment for sargassum to thrive and accumulate along the shores of the Dominican Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do hotels and resorts regularly clean their beaches?</strong> <a href="https://sargassumhub.org/the-dominican-republic/#toggle-id-2">It depends.</a> While many hotels and resorts make efforts to clean their beaches and remove seaweed, the frequency and effectiveness of these cleanups vary. Some resorts prioritize maintaining pristine beaches for their guests, while others may face challenges due to the sheer volume of sargassum or limited resources.
